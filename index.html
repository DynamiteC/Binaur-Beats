            <h3> What is a Binaural Beats ?</h3>
            <p>A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with
                frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a
                listener dichotically (one through each ear). For example, if a 230 Hz pure tone is presented to a
                subject"s right ear, while a 220 Hz pure tone is presented to the subject"s left ear, the listener will
                perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two pure-tones presented to each ear.
                The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating
                to a frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the 220 Hz and 230 Hz pure tones presented to
                each ear.</p>

                                <p> These are lower frequency waves: The state is generated when our thoughts are really
                                    not concentrated and our minds wonder freely, or we are in a relaxed state such as
                                    meditating or daydreaming. We also experience Alpha Brainwaves when we are gently
                                    busy with routine tasks like pottering in the garden, taking a shower, putting on
                                    makeup, doing light housework. Alpha is considered to be the bridge between the
                                    conscious mind and the subconscious mind. </p>

                                <p> Beta is the most common brain wave pattern: Beta brainwaves are produced when we are
                                    wide awake, alert, active and engaged in mental activity, usually involving more the
                                    rational, reality-oriented left hemisphere of our brain. When beta wave activity
                                    becomes very intense, our brain hemispheres become less synchronized. Beta state is
                                    required to function properly in your everyday life.</p>

                                    the gateway to the unconscious mind and the collective unconscious, bringing access
                                    to the universal psyche or mind.</p>

                                    considered the the brainwave that is able to link and process information from all
                                    parts of the brain. It is the frequency that brings with it the ability to process
                                    large amounts of information in relatively small amounts of time. Think of
                                    generating more Gamma activity as getting a processor upgrade for your brain.</p>

                                <p> Theta brainwave states have been used in meditation for centuries: It is common for
                                    people to feel as if they are in a trance, where the mind feels as though it may
                                    have gone to sleep although it is conscious of what is happening around it. Theta
                                    induces a capacity for prolonged daydreaming, where a loss of time may be
                                    experienced. </p>

                by Peniston and Kulkosky, 1989</span><br />
            <br />
            This experiment involved two groups of alcoholics; one group was sent to a
            regular "12 step" AA programme for help with their condition (control
            group); the other group received no counselling but were sent for 15
            twenty-minute sessions of alpha and theta binaural beats usage
            (experimental group).<br />
            <br />
            Within the AA-attending control group, alcoholism relapse rates 13
            months after the test were at 80%. There was no change in levels of
            depression (as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory).<br />
            <br />
            Within the Binaural Beat using experimental group, 13 months later
            there was <span style="font-weight: 400; color: rgb(39, 117, 156);">only
                a 20% relapse</span>, and <span style="font-weight: 400; color: rgb(39, 117, 156);">levels of
                depression had reduced </span>to that of a third, non-alcoholic
            control group.<br />
            <br />
            This is a *huge* improvement on the AA results!<br />

            In this first piece of Binaural Beat research, Dr Oster conclusively
            proved that <span style="font-weight: 400; color: rgb(39, 117, 156);">Binaural
                Beats do cause Brain Wave Entrainment</span>. This essentially means

            This study also confirmed that <span style="font-weight: 400; color: rgb(39, 117, 156);">the brain
                synchronises when Binaural Beats are played</span>.<br />
